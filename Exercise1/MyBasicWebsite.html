<h1>Web-Based Applications Design and Development</h1>
<h2>Me and My Course</h2>

<p><b>Kort Triemsta</b> I am a student at UNCC and I am taking this course because it is a <em>pre-requisate<em/> for other <em>interesting courses<em/>. My strategies include study materials provided by the zyBooks
    not procrastinating and talking with other students, and a little bit of co-pilot to help with syntax.
</p>

<p><b> I</b> My other hobbies include videogames and various outdoor activities. One of which is Airsofting. Airsoft is a competitive team shooting sport in which participants eliminate opponents by hitting each other with spherical plastic projectiles launched via replica air weapons called airsoft guns. It is a recreational activity that can be played indoors or outdoors, often involving military simulation and tactical scenarios.</p>

<p>I don't understand how the UNCC system works fully so I will visit office hours, but in the meantime I learned how to use Githubs Static Webpage feature, I hope that I can use this over the UNCC system as Github is used outside of school more often.</p>
